# pythOS
	
## Setup

Requirements:

- numpy
- scipy

Optional:

- firedrake - for finite element capabilities
- Irksome - for additional finite element capabilities
- SUNDIALS (v7) - to use any of the sundials solvers for a subintegration

## Usage

The relevent code must be on the `PYTHONPATH` prior to import.

On Unix systems, this can be achieved by running

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH

```
from the root directory of pythOS.

On Windows systems, this can be acheived by running 

```
set PYTHONPATH=%CD%;%PYTHONPATH%
```

### Using SUNDIALS:

If using SUNDIALS, prior to use, the wrapper library must be built.

On Unix systems, a Makefile is provided to build the wrapper.  Both the wrapper and the SUNDIALS lib folder must be in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

On Windows systems, the build has been tested using the Visual Studio build tools. The pythOS wrapper code expects the SUNDIALS library to be installed in a dependencies/install_sundials sub-directory.  Following this, the wrapper can be built with

```
cl /LD sundials_wrapper.c -I dependencies\install_sundials\include
```

Then the sundials wrapper can be used in pythOS without any additional setup.
### Fractional Step solver:

The main function provided is `fractional_step`.

It takes as inputs:

- the operators to use
     	 
	these must be in a list in the order you wish to use them,
	and each must be callable with arguments (t, y) and return a numpy 
	array, unless using the finite element capabilities.
	
	If using firedrake for finite elements, these may be a function 
	callable with arguments (t, y) and returning a `Function` if using 
	only explicit Runge-Kutta methods for the operator. 
	Otherwise, these must be Forms, or tuples containing Forms and boundary
	conditions.  Note that if boundary conditions are supplied for the explicit
	or EPI methods, the value must be the time derivative of the boundary 
	condition.
	
	If using a solver from Irksome, the Form must include the 
	appropriate Dt terms. Otherwise, the Form must not contain any 
	Dt terms.
	
- delta_t

	the time step to advance by, which may be an integer or a float, 
	or a Constant.  If using the Irksome solvers, this must be a Constant.
- initial_y

	the initial value(s) to use for y
	
	this may be a single number or a 1-dimensional numpy array
	
	If using the finite element version, this must be of type Function
	
- initial_t

	the time value to start at
	
	If using the finite element version, this must be of type Constant
- final_t

	the time value to advance to

    - 'AK2s5-3':Auzinger-Ketcheson 2nd-order 5-stage, ABC scheme, http://www.othmar-koch.org/splitting/
	
	Two N-split methods are also defined, which determine 
	the appropriate number of operators based on the input 
	list of operators.
	- 'Godunov-N': Godunov for any number of operators
	- 'Strang-N': Strang for any number of operators

	To define a splitting method, the input is a list of lists.

	 When using the finite element capabilities of firedrake this is a 
	 .h5 file accessible through the `CheckpointFile` interface from 
	 `firedrake`. The file has attributes `/times/idx/` that store the time 
	 of each entry and the attribute `/time/last_idx` indicates the last 
	 valid index. The `Function`s are stored using corresponding indices. 
	 Otherwise this is a .csv file containing time in the first entry of each 
	 line, and the solution in the remaining entries

- save\_steps: the number of intermediate steps to save.  
  
	 The default is to save steps at delta\_t time interval if a filename

		 tableau, explicit tableau), and the provided operator should 
		 also be a tuple of (explicit operator, explicit operator), of 
		 which either (tableau and operator) may be None. 
		 When using MRIStep as an adaptive solver, the provided operator must 
		 have form ((fast implicit, fast explicit), (slow implicit, slow 
		 explicit)) with any of the operators optionally being None.

		scipy.integrate.solve\_ivp, an implemented embedded pair, an instance 
		of the `EmbeddedTableau` class, or `CV_BDF` or `CV_ADAMS` or method 
		from ERKStep or ARKStep (with method specification as with the 
		adaptive options for ARKODE).  This uses an ODE integration as the underlying solver.
