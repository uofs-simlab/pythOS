# Improving the stability and efficiency of high-order operator-splitting methods

This repository contains the source codes for the experiments presented in the paper S. Wei, V. Guenter, and R.J. Spiteri, "Improving the stability and efficiency of high-order operator-splitting methods"

## Contents
The file `Niederer.py` contains the code implementing the problem.  To run an experiment, change the dt, alpha and experiment variables as required.

The code uses the `pythOS` library.  For details on how to set up this library, see the main [README](https://github.com/uofs-simlab/pythOS/blob/main/README.md)
